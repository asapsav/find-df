    "Today we are excited to announce the release of `YouRetriever`, the easiest way to get access to the You.com Search API. The You.com Search API is designed by LLMs for LLMs with an emphasis on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. We accomplish this by evaluating our API on a number of datasets to benchmark performance of LLMs in the RAG-QA setting. In this blog post we will compare and contrast the You.com Search API with the Google Search API as well as give the reader the tools to evaluate LLMs in the RAG-QA setting. We will evaluate our retriever performance on [Hotpot QA](https://github.com/hotpotqa/hotpot) using the `RetrievalQA` Chain. Hotpot is a dataset which is comprised of a question, answer, and context. The context can vary in relevance to the question/answer with a special \"distractor\" setting where the LLM needs to not be distracted by certain misleading text within the context. In this experiment we will be removing the context from the dataset and replacing it with text snippets which come back from the search APIs. In this sense the entire internet is the distractor text since the APIs are responsible for finding the answer to the question across the entire internet not just within the list of snippets supplied in the dataset. We call this the \"web distractor\" setting for evaluating search APIs with respect to their performance being used in conjunction with an LLM."
